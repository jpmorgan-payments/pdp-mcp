# About

This repository provides a showcase and reference implementation of an MCP server for the JPMorgan Payments Developer Portal. The MCP server allows external developers to locally download and connect it to their agent environment of choice. It encapsulates all public API documentation from the Payments Developer Portal and offers three core capabilities:

* Search Documentation: Efficiently locate relevant API documentation.
* Read Documentation: Access and review detailed documentation content.
* Find Related Documentation: Discover associated and supplementary documentation.

This implementation serves as a reference for developers seeking to integrate with JPMorgan Payments APIs and streamline their development workflows.
